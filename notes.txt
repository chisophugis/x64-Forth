; IDEA
; have the control block actually be a real block, with all of the
; variables being "live updating" (magenta) variables (will want to have
; each one have its own word anyway). this would make a good "first block"
; for the editor, since it already contains all of its values.

; IDEA
; vector each keystroke with one level of indirection. first the key
; indexes into a *byte* table, to save space. Then the value at that byte
; is used to vector through a table of code pointers, passing the key's
; value as an argument.

; RANDOM
; backspace puts words onto a stack, "paste" puts words from the top of the
; stack in (and puts the cursor AFTER) the pasted word

; RANDOM
; can have a magic "circular stack" by using XMM shuffles

; NOTE
; for the implementation of */ and / that I have in Forth, the remainder is
; left in the A register.

; NOTE Chuck Moore's colorForth optimizes loads and stores to literal
; (fixed) addresses *so that they don't disturb A*.
