Record different design choices I have observed



the problem with having explicit colors for whether a word is executed now
or later (e.g. the "one dictionary" approach) is that you still run into
the problem of needing "cyan" words. For example, if @ is a macro that is
executed while compiling, what if you want to @ interactively? I think the
basic principle of the color is to have the green mean "what gets compiled
into the dictionary by this green word is what the name of the word
represents". In that regard, the cyan words are correct to stand out, since
they do not represent what the name of the word suggests getting compiled
into the dictionary, they represent a call to that word, which behaves
differently (compiles into the dictionary).
