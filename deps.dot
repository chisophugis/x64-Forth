  // is it worth using BLUE to mark defining words (words that textually
  // consume other words ahead of them)? Or is yellow distinguising enough?
  // BLUE executed at edit time? how about BLACK executed at edit time?
  // that seems to fit a lot better with the fact that they are usually
  // invisible in the editor.
  // and what about GRAY?
  // and WHITE?
  // RULE for colors: a color can only be used to implement a functionality
  // that would otherwise not be possible.
